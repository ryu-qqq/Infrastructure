# tfsec Security Scan Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines security baselines and rules for Terraform code scanning.
# Based on infrastructure governance standards (docs/governance/infrastructure_governance.md)
#
# Usage:
#   tfsec --config-file .tfsec/config.yml terraform/
#
# Documentation:
#   https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/latest/guides/configuration/
#

# Minimum severity level to report (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
# Set to MEDIUM to catch most security issues while avoiding noise
minimum_severity: MEDIUM

# Exclude specific checks by rule ID
# Use sparingly - document why each exclusion is necessary
exclude:
  # Example: Exclude S3 bucket versioning check for temporary buckets
  # - aws-s3-enable-versioning

  # Add exclusions only with proper justification
  # Format: - aws-{service}-{check-name}

# Severity overrides - customize severity levels for specific checks
severity_overrides:
  # Encryption-related checks are CRITICAL for our infrastructure
  aws-s3-encryption-customer-key: CRITICAL
  aws-rds-encrypt-instance-storage-data: CRITICAL
  aws-ecr-enforce-immutable-tags: HIGH

  # Public access checks
  aws-s3-block-public-acls: CRITICAL
  aws-s3-block-public-policy: CRITICAL
  aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr: HIGH
  aws-rds-no-public-db-access: CRITICAL

# Custom checks directory (if using custom tfsec checks)
# custom_check_dir: .tfsec/custom_checks

# Include specific paths only (relative to terraform root)
# Useful for excluding test fixtures or examples
include:
  - terraform/atlantis/**
  - terraform/logging/**
  - terraform/monitoring/**
  - terraform/modules/**

# Exclude specific paths from scanning
exclude_paths:
  - terraform/.terraform/**
  - terraform/**/.terraform/**
  - terraform/**/test/**
  - terraform/**/examples/**

# Terraform version constraints
terraform_version:
  minimum: "1.5.0"

# Report formatting options
output:
  format: default  # Options: default, json, csv, sarif, junit
  include_passed: false  # Only show failures to reduce noise
  include_ignored: true  # Show explicitly ignored checks

# Exit codes
# 0 = no issues found
# 1 = issues found at or above minimum_severity
fail_on_severity: MEDIUM

# Soft fail mode for initial rollout
# Set to true to report issues but not fail CI/CD pipeline
# WARNING: Should be set to false in production
soft_fail: false

# GitHub integration options
github:
  enabled: true
  # API token should be provided via GITHUB_TOKEN env var
  # Used for PR comments and annotations

# Performance options
performance:
  max_workers: 4  # Parallel scanning threads
  timeout: 300    # Maximum scan duration in seconds

# Custom metadata for reports

  project: infrastructure
  team: platform-team
