## üìÅ Contents

### `atlantis-iam/`
**Status**: Archived (2025-10-14)

**Status**: Archived (2025-10-14)  
**Original Purpose**: Infrastructure bootstrap configuration (S3 backend, DynamoDB, initial setup)  
**Current State**: Contains only Terraform lock file

## üìã Archive Policy

### What's Here
- **State Files**: Preserved for AWS resource tracking
- **Lock Files**: Terraform provider version constraints
- **Documentation**: Original README files explaining historical context

### What to Do
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Do not delete or modify these directories
- ‚úÖ **Reference**: Use for historical context or troubleshooting
- ‚ùå **Do Not Modify**: These are read-only archives
- ‚ùå **Do Not Run**: Do not execute `terraform apply/destroy` in these directories

### State File Safety
State files may contain:
- Resource identifiers (ARNs, IDs)
- Configuration snapshots
- **Note**: Sensitive values should be stored in AWS Secrets Manager, not state files

If you need to remove resources tracked by these state files:
1. Review state contents: `terraform state list`
2. Manually delete AWS resources via Console
3. Or use `terraform state rm` to untrack without deletion
